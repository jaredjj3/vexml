 * Represents a musical beam, which connects consecutive notes of shorter durations.
 *
 * The `Beam` class encapsulates the linear graphical symbols used to group consecutive quavers (eighth notes) and
 * shorter duration notes. Beaming affects the visual presentation of music but not its rhythmic interpretation. By
 * connecting these notes, beams help in visually organizing the music, making it easier to read, especially in passages
 * with complex rhythms.
 *
 * Beams are crucial in indicating metric groupings and showing phrasing, especially in pieces with irregular or complex
 * time signatures.
